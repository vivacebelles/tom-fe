Several unsuccessful runs due to a SCF processing error. Chatted with EF and found coordinates have two molecules!

Module upgrade yesterday, may affect runs, but full run time on optimizations and calculations have been completed for first successful tests. 
Unfortunately, forgot to change multiplicity on dft function, so error came up in the files. 
Can't run until incompatibility with slurm is fixed. 1106
